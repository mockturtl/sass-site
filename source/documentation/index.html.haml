  Sass is a stylesheet language that's compiled to CSS. It allows you to use
  [variables](variables), [nested rules](nested rules), [mixins](mixins),
  [functions](functions), and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass
  helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design
  within and across projects.

  * If you're looking for an introduction to Sass, check out [the
    tutorial](/guide).

  * If you want to look up a built-in Sass function, look no further than [the
    function reference](functions).

  * If you're calling Sass from JavaScript, you may want the [JS API
    documentation][].

  * Or the [Dart API documentation][] if you're calling it from Dart.

  * Otherwise, read on for the table of contents for the language reference!
